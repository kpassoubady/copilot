# Project 6: Developing Microservices Architecture with Docker and Kubernetes

## Duration

**3 hours and 30 minutes** (including a 20-minute break)

## Tasks

### 1. Microservices Design

* Design a simple microservices architecture (e.g., user service, product service, order service).
* Create basic implementations of each service using a preferred language/framework.

### 2. Dockerization

* Write Dockerfiles for each microservice.
* Use GitHub Copilot to assist in creating `docker-compose.yml` for local development.

### 3. Kubernetes Deployment

* Create Kubernetes deployment YAML files for each service.
* Implement service and ingress resources.

### 4. Service Communication

* Implement inter-service communication (e.g., using REST or gRPC).
* Use GitHub Copilot to help write client code for service-to-service calls.

### 5. Monitoring and Logging

* Integrate a basic monitoring solution (e.g., Prometheus).
* Implement centralized logging (e.g., using ELK stack or cloud-native solutions).

## Target Audience

* **Backend and Full-Stack Developers**: Those looking to learn microservices with a modern, high-performance framework.
* **DevOps Engineers**: Interested in managing containerized microservices with Docker and Kubernetes.
* **JavaScript Developers**: Those familiar with JavaScript who want to use it in a high-performance backend setup.

## Summary of Agenda and Benefits

### Microservices Design (45 minutes)

* Design a simple architecture with services (user, product, order) using Fastify in JavaScript.
* **Benefits**: Fastify offers fast routing and JSON schema support for efficient API handling, and Copilot assists in generating boilerplate service code.

### Dockerization (45 minutes)

* Write Dockerfiles for each service.
* Use `docker-compose.yml` for local orchestration.
* **Benefits**: Fastify’s lightweight footprint makes it ideal for containerization, and Copilot simplifies Docker configuration.

### Kubernetes Deployment (1 hour)

* Create Kubernetes YAML files for deploying each Fastify service.
* Configure services and ingress resources.
* **Benefits**: Copilot aids in setting up Kubernetes resources, and Fastify is resource-efficient, enhancing scalability.

### Service Communication (45 minutes)

* Implement inter-service RESTful communication.
* **Benefits**: Fastify’s async capabilities and Copilot’s code generation make setting up service-to-service calls smoother.

### Monitoring and Logging (45 minutes)

* Integrate Prometheus and use a centralized logging solution.
* **Benefits**: Fastify’s plugin ecosystem supports flexible logging and monitoring.

## Participation Requirements

* **JavaScript Knowledge**: Familiarity with JavaScript, including async/await.

### Setup Requirements

* Docker, Kubernetes CLI, and GitHub Copilot.
* Fastify and Node.js installed.
