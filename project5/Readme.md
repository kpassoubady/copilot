# Project 5: Serverless ETL Pipeline

## Duration

**3 hours and 30 minutes** (including a 20-minute break)

## Tasks

### 1. Data Source Setup

* Set up a sample data source (e.g., S3 bucket with CSV files).
* Create a trigger for new data arrivals.

### 2. ETL Function

* Develop a serverless function (e.g., AWS Lambda, Azure Functions) for data transformation.
* Use GitHub Copilot to assist in writing data parsing and transformation logic.

### 3. Data Storage

* Set up a data warehouse or database for transformed data.
* Implement efficient data insertion or upsert operations.

### 4. Orchestration

* Create a workflow to coordinate the ETL process (e.g., AWS Step Functions, Azure Logic Apps).
* Implement error handling and retries.

### 5. Monitoring and Logging

* Set up CloudWatch, Grafana, or equivalent for monitoring the ETL pipeline.
* Implement detailed logging for each step of the process.

## Target Audience

* **Data Engineers and Cloud Developers**: Professionals looking to build serverless ETL pipelines using cloud services and Prisma ORM.
* **Full-Stack Developers**: Developers who want to integrate database management using Prisma ORM in their data processing workflows.

## Summary of Agenda and Benefits

### Data Source Setup (30 minutes)

* Set up a sample data source (e.g., an S3 bucket with CSV files).
* Create a trigger for new data arrivals using an event-driven approach.
* Use GitHub Copilot to assist in setting up the S3 event trigger code.
* **Benefits**: Automated event detection and trigger setup for processing new data.

### ETL Function (50 minutes)

* Develop a serverless function (e.g., AWS Lambda) to handle data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL).
* Parse and transform incoming data using Lambda.
* Use Copilot to write parsing and transformation logic.
* **Benefits**: Copilot assists in writing optimized ETL logic, improving productivity and reducing manual errors.

### Data Storage with Prisma ORM (40 minutes)

* Set up a database using Prisma ORM (SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.) for storing the transformed data.
* Use Prismaâ€™s schema definitions to structure your data models and manage database operations like Upsert.
* Use Copilot to assist in writing Prisma queries for efficient data insertion/upserts.
* **Benefits**: Prisma simplifies complex database interactions, ensuring seamless and efficient data management.

### Orchestration (45 minutes)

* Use AWS Step Functions to orchestrate the ETL process.
* Implement retries and error handling for robust data processing.
* Use Copilot to streamline the orchestration setup.
* **Benefits**: Reduces development time for orchestration and increases pipeline reliability.

### Monitoring and Logging (30 minutes)

* Set up Grafana or similar tools for monitoring the ETL pipeline.
* Implement detailed logging to track the flow of data through the pipeline.
* Use Copilot to write logging and monitoring code.
* **Benefits**: Enhanced observability and troubleshooting for ETL operations.

## Participation Requirements

* **Familiarity with Cloud Services**: Basic knowledge of AWS services like Lambda, S3, and Step Functions.
* **Basic Prisma ORM Knowledge**: Understanding of using Prisma for database interactions.

### Tools Setup

* AWS account, Prisma ORM setup, PostgreSQL/MySQL database ready.
* Grafana or other monitoring tools set up for pipeline health visualization.
* GitHub Copilot enabled in their IDE (e.g., VSCode).

* **Optional**: Experience with SQL or database schema design.
