# Project 4: Automated Testing for Web Application using Selenium

## Duration

**3 hours and 30 minutes** (including a 20-minute break)

## Tasks

### 1. Install Necessary Tools and Libraries

* Java
* Selenium WebDriver
* Browser driver (e.g., ChromeDriver)

### 2. Writing Basic Test Scripts

* Set up the project structure.
* Write a basic test script to open a web page and verify its title.
* Implement test cases for critical user flows (e.g., login, navigation).

### 3. Advanced Test Cases and Browser Compatibility

* Write test scripts for different browsers (e.g., Firefox, Safari).
* Implement test cases for more complex user interactions (e.g., form submissions, AJAX requests).

### 4. Integrating Selenium Tests with CI/CD

* Set up a CI/CD pipeline to run Selenium tests automatically.
* Use GitHub Actions for integration.

## Target Audience

* **QA Engineers and Test Automation Developers**: Professionals familiar with Java, looking to learn or enhance their skills in automated testing using Selenium.
* **Java Developers**: Developers who want to integrate test automation into their workflow to ensure the quality of web applications.
* **DevOps Engineers**: Those interested in incorporating automated tests in a CI/CD pipeline with Java and Selenium.

## Summary of Agenda and Benefits

### Install Necessary Tools and Libraries (40 minutes)

* Install Java, Selenium WebDriver, and a browser driver like ChromeDriver.
* Set up the working environment, including Maven for dependency management.
* Use GitHub Copilot to help scaffold the project structure and Selenium setup code.
* **Benefits**: Copilot assists in setting up project dependencies, avoiding manual setup errors, and ensuring proper configuration of the Java environment for Selenium.

### Writing Basic Test Scripts (50 minutes)

* Set up the project structure with proper package organization.
* Write a basic Selenium test script in Java to open a web page, verify its title, and implement test cases for critical user flows (e.g., login and navigation).
* Use Copilot to assist in generating Selenium test scripts, simplifying the process of writing verification logic.
* **Benefits**: Copilot speeds up the process of writing basic test scripts by auto-suggesting common methods and assertions, reducing development time.

### Advanced Test Cases and Browser Compatibility (50 minutes)

* Write test scripts for different browsers (e.g., Firefox, Safari) to ensure browser compatibility.
* Implement test cases for more complex user interactions such as form submissions, AJAX requests, and dynamic content.
* Use Copilot to help generate browser-specific test scripts and complex interactions with Selenium WebDriver.
* **Benefits**: Copilot reduces the manual effort required to write cross-browser test cases and handle complex interactions.

### Integrating Selenium Tests with CI/CD (45 minutes)

* Set up a CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions to automatically run Selenium tests after code changes.
* Ensure proper integration with the Selenium WebDriver in the CI environment.
* Use Copilot to generate GitHub Actions configuration files for running Selenium tests.
* **Benefits**: Copilot simplifies setting up the pipeline, reduces errors, and ensures that tests are continuously executed as part of the development lifecycle.

## Participation Requirements

* **Java Knowledge**: Participants should be comfortable with Java programming, including object-oriented concepts.
* **Familiarity with Web Applications**: Understanding of basic web navigation and user interactions.

### Tools Setup

* Java installed along with Maven for dependency management.
* Selenium WebDriver and browser drivers (e.g., ChromeDriver, GeckoDriver for Firefox).
* GitHub Copilot enabled in their IDE (e.g., IntelliJ).

* **Optional**: Familiarity with GitHub Actions for CI/CD integration.
