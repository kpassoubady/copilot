# Project 2: Full-Stack Web Application with React and Node.js

Duration: 3 hours and 30 mins (with 20 mins break)

## Tasks

1. Frontend Setup

   * Create a new React project using the Create React App.
   * Design a basic user interface with components.

2. Backend Development

   * Set up a Node.js server with Express.
   * Create API endpoints for user authentication and resource management.

3. User Authentication

   * Implement user registration and login.
   * Use JWT for authentication and authorization.

4. Frontend-Backend Integration

   * Connect React frontend with Node.js backend.
   * Implement API calls in React using Axios or Fetch API.

5. Deployment

   * Deploy the full-stack application.
   * Ensure the application is running smoothly.

## Target Audience

* **Frontend and Backend Developers (Beginner to Intermediate)**
  * Developers with basic knowledge of either frontend or backend development, looking to enhance their skills by building a full-stack application.
* **Full-Stack Developers**
  * Professionals or students aiming to improve their knowledge of integrating React with Node.js and deploying web applications.
* **Software Engineers transitioning to Web Development**
  * Those interested in learning the complete workflow of building and deploying full-stack applications.

## Summary of Agenda and Benefits

### Frontend Setup (40 minutes)

* Introduction to Create React App for quick project setup.
* Create a basic UI with React components such as navigation, forms, and basic styling.
* Use GitHub Copilot to assist with creating components, JSX structure, and state management.
* Benefits: Speeds up React component creation, reduces time spent on repetitive code and helps developers follow best practices.

### Backend Development (50 minutes)

* Set up a Node.js server using Express for handling requests and responses.
* Create simple API endpoints for user authentication and resource management.
* Use GitHub Copilot to help scaffold Express routes and middleware functions.
* Benefits: Automates the generation of boilerplate code for API endpoints, improving productivity in backend development.

### User Authentication (50 minutes)

* Implement user registration and login using JWT for secure authentication.
* Use Copilot to generate code for JWT token handling, middleware for protected routes, and user validation logic.
* Benefits: Copilot reduces the manual effort required to implement JWT authentication, which often involves repetitive code patterns and security checks.

### Frontend-Backend Integration (40 minutes)

* Connect the React frontend to the Node.js backend by making API calls.
* Implement Axios or Fetch to make HTTP requests and update the front end based on responses.
* Use Copilot to assist in writing efficient API calls and handling responses in React.
* Benefits: Streamlines the integration process between frontend and backend, saving time when connecting React components to APIs.

### Deployment (30 minutes)

* Deploy the full-stack application to a platform like Vercel (optional for frontend) and Heroku/Render (optional for backend).
* Ensure the application runs smoothly, with the front and backend communicating successfully.
* Use Copilot to write deployment scripts and configure settings.
* Benefits: Helps in setting up deployment scripts, environment variables, and configuration settings, which can be tedious for first-time deployers.

## Participation Requirements

* **Basic Knowledge of JavaScript**
  * Understanding JavaScript concepts such as variables, functions, and asynchronous programming.
* **Familiarity with React**
  * Participants should know the basics of React, including components, props, and state management.
* **Familiarity with Node.js**
  * Some exposure to creating a basic server with Express is preferred.

### Tools Setup

* Node.js and npm installed.
* VSCode (or another IDE) with GitHub Copilot enabled.
* Create React App, Express.js, Axios, or Fetch installed.
* GitHub Copilot Access: Participants should have Copilot enabled to benefit from its code-suggestion features during the session.
